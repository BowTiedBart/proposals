<h1>Partnership Proposal With Toupee Tech</h1>

<img src="https://www.toupee.tech/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Ftokens%2Ftoupee.png&w=128&q=75" alt="Toupee Tech Logo">

<h2>Toupee Tech Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>An entirely new protocol on Base built with features from Solidly.</strong> Toupee is a coordinator of incentives within ecosystems built on the Solidly model. Protocols that stake LP tokens in Toupee earn extra rewards in oWIG emissions on top of the rewards earned from the underlying protocol.</li>
    <li><strong>No long-term token locking.</strong> Toupee operates with a 1-week epoch system, which is also the max token lock duration. Gone are the days of multi-year token locks.</li>
    <li><strong>4:1 bribing efficiency.</strong> Currently our partner protocols are getting $4 for every $1 they put in bribes, the best in the Base ecosystem. Toupee is also matching bribes for all new partner protocols dollar for dollar.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to get started with Toupee?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Toupee allows restaking of any base DEX LP tokens (or any other yield-bearing asset) into a Toupee gauge.</li>
    <li>We will make a plugin for Stargate in our protocol for seamless integration the same way we have already done for Aerodrome and Velocimeter.</li>
    <li>As part of the partnership, you will be airdropped voting power, which can be used to bribe the Toupee gauge.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no financial risk involved in entering the Toupee ecosystem as a partner, only upside.</p>

<h2>What does Toupee deliver?</h2>
<p>Toupee is an up-and-coming incentive coordinator on Base. It can deliver a value proposition for protocols by serving as one of its incentive hubs on the Base ecosystem.</p>
<p>Toupee also uses its proprietary plug-in system to incorporate the rewards of underlying DEXs into its own reward structure. This makes it a win-win for partnering protocols.</p>
<p>Toupee streams $oWIG emissions to liquidity pools based on weekly vWIG votes. Protocols can use voter incentives (bribes) to attract vWIG votes and oWIG emissions to build liquidity on Base in a capital-efficient way.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Protocols incentivizing on Toupee have been achieving an efficiency ratio of 4X. In other words, for every dollar in voter incentives, participants in our ecosystem are currently directing $4 worth of oWIG emissions and rewards towards their pools. Protocols can leverage this high efficiency to attract more liquidity at a low cost.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the voting flywheel is highlighted by Toupee's quickly growing TVL which has reached almost $1.5M as of the time of this writing.</p>
